# Development Rules

This directory contains development guidelines and best practices in the modern Cursor Rules format (MDC). These rules are automatically applied based on file patterns and provide context-aware guidance to AI assistants.

## Rules Overview

### Core Guidelines
- **architecture.mdc** - Project overview, technology stack, and infrastructure setup (Always Applied)
- **project-structure.mdc** - Project organization and directory structure (Always Applied)

### Code Quality
- **typescript-guidelines.mdc** - TypeScript best practices and conventions (Auto-attached to .ts/.tsx files)
- **code-style.mdc** - General coding standards and style guide (Auto-attached to code files)
- **file-structure.mdc** - File and directory organization patterns (Auto-attached to config files)

### Framework Development
- **react-guidelines.mdc** - React development principles and patterns (Auto-attached to React files)
- **state-management.mdc** - State management approaches and best practices (Auto-attached to state files)

### Testing & Quality
- **testing-guidelines.mdc** - Testing strategies and best practices (Auto-attached to test files)

### Documentation
- **documentation.mdc** - Documentation standards and conventions (Auto-attached to .md files)

## How Rules Work

### Automatic Attachment
Rules are automatically included in your AI context based on file patterns (globs). When you work on TypeScript files, the TypeScript guidelines are automatically loaded.

### Manual Reference
You can manually reference any rule using the `@ruleName` syntax:
- `@architecture` - Include project architecture guidance
- `@typescript-guidelines` - Load TypeScript best practices
- `@react-guidelines` - Get React recommendations
- `@testing-guidelines` - Get testing recommendations

### Rule Types Used
- **Always Applied** - Loaded in every context (architecture.mdc, README.mdc)  
- **Auto Attached** - Loaded when matching file patterns are referenced
- **Agent Requested** - Available for AI to include when relevant
- **Manual** - Only included when explicitly mentioned

## Development Commands

### Common Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev                    # Start development server
npm run build                  # Build for production
npm run lint                   # Run linter
npm run typecheck              # Type checking

# Testing
npm test                       # Run unit tests
npm run test:watch             # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage          # Generate coverage report
```

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Rules are automatically applied based on file context
- Check rule descriptions to understand when they're activated
- Use manual references (`@ruleName`) for additional context
- Keep rules updated as the codebase evolves

### For AI Assistants
- Rules provide consistent guidance across conversations
- Use rule context to maintain coding standards
- Reference specific rules when making recommendations
- Apply rule principles in code suggestions and reviews

## Contributing to Rules

### Adding New Rules
1. Create a new `.mdc` file in this directory
2. Include proper metadata headers with description and globs
3. Write clear, actionable guidelines with examples
4. Test the rule with relevant file patterns
5. Update this README if needed

### Updating Existing Rules
1. Modify the rule content while preserving metadata
2. Test changes with affected file patterns
3. Ensure consistency with other rules
4. Update examples and best practices as needed

## Rule Format Reference

Each rule file uses the MDC format with metadata:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of the rule's purpose
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]  # File patterns for auto-attachment
alwaysApply: false              # Whether to always include this rule
---

# Rule Title

Rule content in Markdown format...
```

## Rule Metadata Fields

- **description**: Brief description of what the rule covers
- **globs**: Array of file patterns (e.g., `["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]`) that trigger auto-attachment
- **alwaysApply**: Boolean flag to always include this rule in context (default: false)

## Best Practices

1. **Keep rules focused** - Each rule should cover a specific domain or concern
2. **Use clear examples** - Include code examples showing both good and bad practices
3. **Update regularly** - Keep rules in sync with your codebase evolution
4. **Test patterns** - Verify glob patterns match intended files
5. **Document decisions** - Explain the reasoning behind important conventions
