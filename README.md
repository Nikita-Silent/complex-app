# Development Project

This project follows modern development best practices with Cursor Rules (MDC format) for consistent code quality and AI-assisted development.

## Development Rules

This project uses Cursor Rules to maintain consistent coding standards and best practices. Rules are automatically applied based on file patterns and provide context-aware guidance.

See [`.cursorrules/README.mdc`](.cursorrules/README.mdc) for complete documentation of all development rules and guidelines.
